<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Install our Github app" icon="message-bot">
    Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
    don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
    your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
    successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
    of the repo.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Push your changes" icon="rocket">
    [Commit and push your changes to
    Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
    for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
    the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
    update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
